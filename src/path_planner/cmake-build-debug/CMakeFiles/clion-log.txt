CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 2.8.12 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.

CMake Warning (dev) at /home/liwei/Downloads/clion-2021.1/bin/cmake/linux/share/cmake-3.19/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:426 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (OMPL) does
  not match the name of the calling package (ompl).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /usr/share/ompl/ompl-config.cmake:102 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
  CMakeLists.txt:63 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
